[Weisweiler et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-019-6174-3) cited the work of [Digel et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1105/tpc.15.00203) for the details of RNA extraction. Here is the description of [Digel et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1105/tpc.15.00203): 
> The samples harvested for RNA extraction were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. Total RNA, excluding miRNAs, was extracted from ground tissue using an **RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen) and TRIzol (Life Technologies) for RNA sequencing and qRT-PCR, respectively**. Residual DNA was removed using a **DNA-free kit (Ambion).** RNA extraction and DNase treatment were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The RNA concentration and integrity were determined using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent) before RNA library preparation for RNA sequencing. Owing to the column-based RNA purification method of the RNeasy Micro Kit, only transcript species larger than 200 nucleotides were further processed for RNA sequencing.  


# RNA sequencing
## Sequence depth
According to [Weisweiler et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-019-6174-3), they had around 20 million 2x150 bp reads for one sample. Their finding suggested using 1% \~ 5% of reads can still obtain acceptable prediction ability. 
  
In their article, the authors mentioned that the cost of 20 million 2x150 bp reads is 60 Euro. If we calculate the cost according to this number, the total cost will be `(800 + 15 parents * 3 batches) * 60 = 50700 Euro`. This is definitely not possible to spend so much money on sequencing. So,
