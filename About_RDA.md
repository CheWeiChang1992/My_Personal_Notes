# Background
When I searched for the tools to detect the adaptation signitures, the SNPs probably associating to the adaptation, I found that some researchers using a method called 'redundancy analysis (RDA)' to identify the hiden association between the genomic data matirx and the environmental data, such as elevation and climatic data.  
This document will record my understanding regarding to the RDA technique.
